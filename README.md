### The purpose of this repository is to generate opposite sentiment of sentences. Given a text document, reverse the sentiment of each sentence. If a sentence is positive, make it negative, and if it's negative, make it positive. Neutral sentences should remain unchanged.

### To generate output:
- Download and open the notebook opposite_sentiment_generator.ipynb in google colab
- Connect runtime
- find the notebook cell with upload option and upload(browse) input text file
- run other notebook cells one by one to download, import necessary packages and generate output
